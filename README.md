##Stock Prediction Project

This project focuses on integrating with Discord, fetching stock data, and training a model for stock data predictions. The project consists of three main scripts:

###Discord Integration (Discord Integration.py)
#Purpose:
This script allows for integration with the Discord API. It's designed to facilitate communication between my Get Stock Data app and Discord.

#Usage:
python "Discord Integration.py"

#Key Features:
Establishes a connection to specified Discord servers.
Listens for specific commands or messages for triggering stock-related actions.

###Get Stock Data (Get stock data.py)
#Purpose:
To fetch the latest stock data. The data can be sourced from various stock market platforms or APIs.

#Usage:
python "Get stock data.py"

#Key Features:
Fetches real-time stock data.
Can be configured to fetch data for specific stock symbols or market segments.
Outputs data in a structured format, ready for analysis.

###Training Stock Data for Predictions (Training stock data for predictions.py)
#Purpose:
Uses historical stock data to train a predictive model. This model can then forecast stock prices or trends based on past patterns.

#Usage:
python "Training stock data for predictions.py"

#Key Features:
Implements machine learning algorithms for predictions.
Uses historical data for training.
Outputs a trained model which can be used for future predictions.


#To use these scripts, ensure you have the required packages installed and have set up the necessary configurations, especially in the .env file for sensitive credentials.
